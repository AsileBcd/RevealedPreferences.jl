# RevealedPreferences.jl

A library for revealed preferences analysis using Julia.
It also implements some indices of rationality (Houtman-Maks and the swap index for now).

<!--MCI should be computed from a weighted DiGraph.
MCI, MPI and HMI should be computed from prices and quantities directly, at the individual level.-->
